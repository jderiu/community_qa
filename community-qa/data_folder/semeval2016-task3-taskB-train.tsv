Doha Bank's customer care is horrible. The lady answering the calls does not know even the basics of Doha Bank procedures etc. The others are equally unqualified. God knows how they run such a big bank with all these idiots whose only response is 'Please visit your branch for further deyails'.

I've been in Doha for quite a while now; but I still haven't experienced really authentic butter chicken like the ones you get in India. The butter chicken over here is a bit bland to serve the arabian palate and doesn't do the dish justice. Any suggestions where you can get the real deal? FYI I've been to Shaalimaar (the Indian restaurant near the airport); Bukhara and AliShaan but none of them cut it; for me at least.	1.0	0.999993	5.92742e-06	7.27532e-10	0.00434963	0.00019595	0.00283015	1.78447e-05	0.999998	0.771086	1.0	0.999994	1.61269e-09	3.49369e-14	0.000123522	1.45461e-06	2.32677e-06	1.42684e-07	0.999519	0.000139755	Irrelevant

Since we all came from a woman; got our name from a woman; and our game from a woman. I wonder why we take from woman; why we rape our woman; do we hate our woman? I think its time we killed for our woman; be real to our woman; try to heal our woman; cus if we dont we'll have a race of babies that will hate the ladies; who make the babies. And since a man can't make one he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one. ~ Tupac Shakur	0.00411094	4.15797e-07	2.70922e-06	0.00070041	3.21146e-07	1.11494e-07	1.38447e-06	3.60728e-06	0.00594614	0.00892235	0.000212819	7.53131e-09	1.49605e-05	6.39388e-05	1.66285e-06	2.04974e-07	5.37526e-10	3.03181e-05	0.99428	0.00137973	Irrelevant

Anyone have any advice on how to advertise my search to a Qatari audience?	Life in Qatar can get expensive at times; especially if you have your family here. We all have different needs and spending money becomes less of an option. This means saving money becomes a plan shelved for later. Do you think the depiction is exaggerated or is it actually accurate? Let us know what you think. How did you spend your April salary?	1.0	0.939036	0.298506	1.0	0.0292564	0.962542	0.977773	1.0	0.0224148	0.000640379	0.999997	0.979922	3.32515e-05	0.999739	0.000127213	0.998875	0.996792	1.0	0.000287837	0.00112346	Irrelevant

With the close relationship reflected in QL between the Muslims & Nons it is proven that all religions and race can live side-by-side.

Hello everyone; I have recently moved to Doha; i was based in the UAE before and whenever i wanted to buy cosmetics(make up) i would go to specific small shops to get them; the reason behind this was the price would be about 30% less than the perfumes in fancy stores at malls. And yes; the products were absolutely genuine. Sme brans i bought were estee lauder; loreal; bobbi brown. So; are there such shops in Doha too? If yes; please give me their location. Thank you.	0.997825	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.97823	2.35615e-05	0.323369	0.983632	0.979065	0.995156	0.999999	1.0	1.0	0.999962	0.999946	0.000914519	0.999169	0.997633	9.04869e-05	1.0	Irrelevant

Hi; I'll be moving to Doha for work and would like to use HSBC Qatar for my banking since I'm already using them in my home country. Are those using their services in Qatar; may I check; are their services good and speedy? Are charges reasonable (it's expensive here)? Do they have extensive ATM? Do they pay interests for our saving? How about their premier a/c? Is it worth opening such a/c? Thanks.
