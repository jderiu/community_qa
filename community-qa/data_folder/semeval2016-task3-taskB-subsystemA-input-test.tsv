Your ticket allowance - will they pay you for your ticket on a monthly basis? or will they only give you QR1000 when you are leaving to go home? Sorry your breakdown doesn't make any sense. I get the Basic Salary and Car Allowance and Housing.... What is a ticket allowance 1000; market adjusment 3500; furniture allowance 25000? Are they giving you money to furnish your home? You might as well pocket that money and use it towards getting furnished apartment - which for a 2 bedroom is about QR8;000 - If you are only earning QR13;500; your salary diminishes drastically and you are only left with QR5;500 for a Car; monthly utilities; groceries; school fees and entertainment.... and if you are only getting QR1000 for your airticket home; then you are going to need to save for the rest of your ticket and that of your wife and child.

Listen you can accept the offer but do not expect to save a lot as you will pay almost 4000 for rent; about 1500 to 2000 as car monthly installment & about 3000 at least for monthly expenses without having too much fun. so you will be able to save about 1000 USD per month which is fine for somebody in your age. but if you are expecting to save more then do not come or ask for more.For furniture allowance it is going to be depriciated over 4 years but they will not pay it to u every for year check with them again;for end of year profit share do not expect more than two to three month for the basic maximum. also for promotions it is not that easy may be after 3 or 4 years.So you may accept the offer to gain the gulf expriance then you can start searching for another job in gulf as they always say for egyptians "" you do not have gulf experiance"""	Good

Q321_R21	Q321_R21_C3	jumping to red light	Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?	From my personal experience - The Camera will only flash once you Jump the Red Light which means over the zebra crossing. If you happen to cross the zebra crossing in flashing Green or Yellow you will be lucky enough not to get the picture taken. My sister jumped a Clear Red signal at 38 kms per hr speed and she had to 6000QRS and 7 points on the Drivers license. The traffic dept will have a clear video and recording of the incident which you can verfy with. I hope this does not happen to you.

Q321_R21	Q321_R21_C4	jumping to red light	Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?	Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ... So; If you've crossed the lights while anything but red; you are good. Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly. You can pass through even on amber; but it is just not worth taking that risk. Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.	Good

Q321_R23	Q321_R23_C8	jumping to red light	Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?	Don't generalize your own habits to everybody in here. plus if you don't have any idea about a subject just stay quiet. camera flashes when you pass over the sensors which are installed just on pedestrian walkway in front of you. its not necessary to cross the whole signal to get flashed. my case was exactly the same; happened in small signal near apollo polyclinic. i went over the pedestrian walkway by the same mistake and then returned. i believe he didn't cross the signal coz the opposite side traffic was flowing. camera takes two snapshots plus a short video. even if they fine; he can appeal and video is his proof.

Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....	Good

Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....

Q322_R48	Q322_R48_C5	"Gold loan in Qatar	""Can any body advice where to get gold loan in Qatar?"	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	Good
Q322_R48	Q322_R48_C6	"Gold loan in Qatar	""Can any body advice where to get gold loan in Qatar?"	"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."	Good

"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

Q323_R7	Q323_R7_C5	What was your	first job ever?	The players decide who goes first; perhaps via ip dip; (American: Eeny; meeny; miny; moe) or a variant; then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface; then pick up jacks; then catch the ball before it bounces twice. There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target; if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all. In some variants; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies); next two (twosies); and so on. In most versions of the game; only one hand may be used. To simplify play; both may be used; to make it harder; or to impose a handicap; a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg; the left if right-handed). http://en.wikipedia......	Bad

First time I hear about the 10% thing; might be a new thing but never hear of it. The guys are right as well as the Airport one is less crowded than the Khalifa branch. You can also pay for that in 'Giant Stores' or 'Villagio' as I remember. I saw an office there for the Traffic Department.

Q324_R21	Q324_R21_C3	Paying Cash for Apartment	My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!	Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment. As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....	Good

You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying; in Doha; a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now; so even though there will be some upward potential; i dont think its enough to take the risk second; when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold; 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower; and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold; in dubai; a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days. third; between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together; i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha I always tell the truth; even when I lie	Good

I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago; and it has gone up so say 300;000 ryals. Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it; and I don't yet see an emerging sales market. Personally I am torn now; sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR Rent and hold on to it long term. Right now I am looking at the former; if i can make even 200;000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me. We shall see; I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first; the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable. If al Wabb is cheap then great; get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off; at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower; but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.	Good

"Dear aviduser; actually the same question as already posted by navi ...""what is the situation for residence permit?"" are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion; or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me; since I'm too new for this place. Congrats; for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010;so no return from any of the investment upon that time; which makes bank loan too heavy for me.

"So you hold both. But it means that you don't need exit permits any more. Then if you quit your job you can stay move job do whatever. This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you. In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus. Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6 Rental returns well I don't know; compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully. Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense. Dubai was mentioned earlier; what people fail to mention with that ""boom"" is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion. This meant people with enough cash could secure hundreds of apartments each they then sold the options on these flats on for a little profit and on the cycle went; with only the person holding the flat at the c....."

Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give.

I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.	Good

Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran?

Q324_R35	Q324_R35_C5	Paying Cash for Apartment	My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!	Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.	Good

I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?	PotentiallyUseful

"You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say ""I hope"" and ""I think"" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term ""no-brainer"". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us. PS: I am not critiquing or analysing your decision to buy. I am only seeking more information that you may like to share with us on your analysis. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer"	Good

You cannot factor in convenience - so a vehicle here is a must.	PotentiallyUseful

I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	PotentiallyUseful

But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year.

You can blow off 9000Qr in a week; a month; or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month. You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car.

VNINOH And everyone else - RASGAS Co. First up; congrats on the offer mate; a quick word; RASGAS is a very good company and standards of work and culture are pretty nice... Now coming to your question... The salary that they offer you with QR 8K Basic (having 15yrs of experience) is a TOTAL CRAP...HEAR ME MY FRIEND With that kinda experience I would say a BARE MINIMUM SALARY OF 15000 QR...at a Company like Rasgas...and this my friend is purely purely Basic; cos they normall provide Housing at their Al-Khor Community for Employees and life in there is quite nice; Schooling is covered for your children; yearly air tickets for you and family; MEdical Insurance for you and members of your family; and other such extra perks and yearly bonuses and appraisals are all not included... QR 15000K is a Bare minimum; by the way having said this; whats the position...but irrespective of that; QR 8000 is just a total waste; and DO NOT ACCEPT IT!

Hi I am an engineer having 16 yrs experience recently came to qatar. 8 K Basic is really very very bad salary; according to me don't accept it.

Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people?

But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....	Good

I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!	Bad

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....

I don't mean to sound racist; I'm only speaking of the reality of the workforce in the region; but don't waste your time comparing your offer to that of someone from the West.

This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council. All the rest of the British school claim they ""follow"" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school; they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals.

Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)	Good

Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage; Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also ""reasonably"" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places.

It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school ""it must be the school"". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay; as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism.

Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad.

You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops.

And shame in doing evil; then we needn't/shouldn't have fear or shame in doing what's right and just. What we lack sometimes is the courage or maybe we fear the breaking of ties or loss of some worldly benefits. Or maybe we feel we will not be able to bear the pressure and commitment that may come once we take that path of speaking out against a wrong. The solution then is to first overcome these fears and know that by our keeping quiet not only will a wrong doer get off Scott free and a crime go unpunished; but we may very well find ourselves in the place of the victim next; with no one to speak for us!

"Draccy; YES. And I am sure all will agree. Funny thing is; they will remain passive...saying ""What can we do"" ? That suggests they need a leader; a leader that tells them what to do. Seems there is no one around though. And things are left for others to deal with...others; who don't really have anything to do with the problem in the first place. others; who; due to circumstance; don;t know what kind of evil they are dealing with...hence; are losing one battle after the other. Which leads us to the conclusion that those who are leaderless and ask ""what can we do"" are part of the problem.Non?"	Good

Jackmphan They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract. I am just putting everything into picture; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years. When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance. Almost all took housing allowance; then they called their families on visit visa; once their husbands found a job in qatar; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC. This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent. By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families. Plus not so long ago; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.	Good

It is sort displaying that you belong to a certain race when you're in a minority situation; and i'm not going into the VIP territory again. As for western women wearing it; as long as you're not walking ""alone""; it should be OK. At the least you should be walking with another woman; preferably wearing the same.

Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.	Good

For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary.

I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000.

At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000); but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder.

Jeans from a regular shop in Villagio costs minimum Qar100.00 plus. Women's blouses range from Qar60.00 and much more. Clothes are expensive here; and the quality is not really that well; unless you buy from a signature shop.	Good

As a general rule most UK brands (such as BHS; Next; M&S; H&M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.	Good

I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment. Unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good; so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there!!	PotentiallyUseful

Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars.

Be warned!!!! the worst car dealership i have had the misfortune to go to is the Nissan dealer. Granted; nissan have a great line-up of cars but the poor service of the dealer has made it no joy to own a Nissan. my view; considering best value and quality and after sales service. best 4x4 - toyota (LC or Prado) best luxury saloon - mercedes e class best economy family saloon - maza 6; toyota camry best economy compact - maza 3; toyota yaris worst--- hummer...ssangyong (eg rexton)... anything european (except merc.

I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible..

There are now MANY landlords who are refusing to pay any commission to agents; and this has therefore led almost EVERY main agency in Qatar to start charging tenants. In THEORY; they should provide you with a great; professional service; though admittedly this is not always the case. The UAE has a regulatory body in place....but tenants pay 5% there in fees for EVERY deal! Often the service is terrible there; even with the laws in place. As has been said; it's a one off payment.

Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to; in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.	PotentiallyUseful

One thing I can say is kudos to the dad's; you guys do soooo much to take care of our families and sometimes we mom's get lost in our own worlds to realize it. Welcome to Qatar and send me a message and I'll get you his contact --- email/phone; whatever	Good

Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night; {except when I forget and have caffeine; or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years! Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic. They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed. You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this. Angelwings.	Good

Was wondering if there is any men in a similar situation and any groups or such about? Many thanks"	I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp; while a couple monitored me all night from another room. I was wired up all over the place; which for me wasn't too comfortable; and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'. I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon; who checked the size of my jaw; tongue etc etc; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea. I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross; but wasn't really that bad). But this is definitely the route to take; as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected. Hope you get 'relief' soon...I know what you're going thru! Angelwings	Bad

It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body; which is found in not only the obvious; like tea and coffee; but also in fizzy drinks like coke; seven-up etc; tonic water (very; very bad!!); soda water; beer; and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water. Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep. Also; chocolate is a sleep depriver too. If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed; then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them. Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa; late on in the day; but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under. I stayed awake for four days once; when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth). A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink. He also took four days to figure out what was wrong...and e.....	Bad

I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us.

I use them a lot for a variety of uses as I live in Dukhan. 5 years ago if you called and asked for a taxi tomorrow they would say that nothing was available until 3am two weeks on Tuesday. Now they say yes no problem; call back to confirm the details; call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way. I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed. Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service. By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive. Most forums would not allow it. It is outrageous to define people by their nationality and such serious allegations; if not able to prove are simply slanderous.	Good

"Tallg; When Booth killed Lincoln; he shouted "" Woe to the Traitors""; similar to what Brutus said when he killed Caesar. The Western media has an inherent bias; which is very subtle. Israeli forces are called: IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces) Whereas; a Palestinian child  throwing a rock at an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a ""Future terrorist"" I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower. However; I believe in calling a spade a spade. That's why a magazine like ""The Economist"" is respectable and a media source like ""Fox News"" or ""CNN"" is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners. The Internet; howvere; has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation. :-) zaki the duckie"	PotentiallyUseful

I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! .

As someone who just came back from UAE last week; doha is not even close to what abu dhabi is right now. No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING.

Must be the group or bank; who is or sponsoring the QNB card. Not necesserarily is your bank; is the institution where the alliance for the visa is coming from.

Fact : If your company terminates you; take that letter to your bank ; you won't be required to pay any remaining amount ; bank will use its tacts ; don't yield ; after few days of delay ; finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home .. Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.

Actually as for my case; since I have my valid license in my home; I am entitled for a half course or direct test. Full course may be required if you don't have existing license or expired. Otherwise; no driving school will require a full course. There are a lot of driving schools out there; Al rayya driving school; karwa; etc.	Good

I also have driving licence(from home country) and go for short course but after having pre-test (which is not mandatory)they forced for full course and according to other student it is their practice especially for short course student and important is they never tells students about such so called pre-test at the time of admission after having few classes they inform you about pre-test which is unfair........ while with karawa after completed the classes you can go directly for test with police department(which is quite normal).

Notice rodqie76; he mention that they forcibly or tactfully impose long/full course through so called pre test;and they refuse students to go for the test with traffic department; and after giving admission fee no one think to go any other institute. Why don't they allow direct test with traffic dept;Let them decide who can drive or not.don't pressurize for long course!! Make each and every thing clear at the time of admission. Anyone can help or suggest how to stop out from such situation????	Bad

So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.	Good

Good point razingbull.....but the question comes in mind about the credibility and quality of rest of the institute!!!!and in that case the leverage given by traffic department is just waste because they allow such students to go directly to the TEST..........not enforced pre-test.

"You are lucky Razingbull......if these are quality measures why they are hiding at the time of admission if someone insist to pay exam fee at the same time they said you will pay three days before exams.....why they are showing such double standards;if they are quality conscious then must inform to students ""if you pass pre-test then institute allows you to go for test if you agree then take admission"" other wise they are over ruling the permission given by government/traffic department which allows for direct test or short course."

I think it was because we did not have a male escort they were very being very difficult. It was not a hotel I would normally chosen to have stayed in; but there was a big conference on and I had to resort to this one. Turns out even my marriage certificate was not good enough as we got a knock on the door at 11.00pm and told to leave the hotel .. they said I did not have a ministry stamp on my marriage certificate; nor did I have a LETTER OF PERMISSION from my husband. I was so angry .... I got the man to ring my husband; but that wasn't good enough either .. this was when they said I needed the ministry's stamp on my marriage certificate!!!!!! Anyhows; my husband and I have regularly stayed in hotels in Doha. If you are going to stay in one of the 4 or 5 star ones they generally just ask you to produce your passports.

So far anyone I've met that is with Al Jazeera international seems very content. They have generally good packages (or at least from what I hear) and comfortable accomodations. The staff is diverse with a large number of employees from the UK. I think it should be a good experience. But; really there are no 'suprises' ; but you will really have to come and experience it for yourself. You may love it and someone else may hate it and vise versa.	Good

Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best	Bad
Q341_R32	Q341_R32_C8	who is this che guevara...	What did che guevara do to get so famous?? we see his pic on t shirsts...	aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.	Good

Q342_R1	Q342_R1_C1	"Legal issue: Business and NOT work visa	""Hello; My employer got me a business visa and not a working visa. They said that it's hard to get a work visa so they will just fix my work visa when I get there. Does this really happen? They also said they'll book me a return ticket; but I failed to ask why. I worry that they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance...Hoping someone could enlighten me on this; thanks."	It takes time to apply for a work visa. Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration.

Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully?

There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle; as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas; and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers; and they will stop demanding thier share. Sunny ; as an exception; it does not apply to you. Unlike others; you got your business visa legally; issued by your hiring Company.

If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way; apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification; now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit.

Most of the reputed companies (banks; oil companies) get them easily.

If they bring someone and finds that he is not good or he misbehaves with the officers; then they have the right to kick him out of country; in that case the company gets back that visa and can bring new staff from india...

Certain laws and regulations change; and it can be a frustrating place; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London; and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily. What I will say; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing; and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people. Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping.

I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.	Good

He arranged to come over... and I waited for 5 hours for him. When I tried to ring him to find out where he was; he didn't answer - I called four times.

The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck!

There are usually large open (vacant lots) that you can also allow your dog to run off lead; IF there is no one else around. Contrary to popular belief; dogs are not haram (forbidden); but there are certain steps a muslim must take after touching a dog or if a dog touches something a person uses. You can read up on it online. There was an article today in the Peninsula newspaper about how animals are supposed to be treated in Islam. Basically; just treat everyone you meet (until you know better) as someone who is uncomfortable/afraid of dogs.

He is slightly bigger at 45 kgs...but he is my baby! Also what are the vacant lots? Are these just contained areas where this is nothing? Are there any groups that meet with dogs? It'd be great to meet some other dog lovers as well; and let him socialise. I would always be careful of others feelings towards dogs; as I know not everyone will love him.	Bad

I live in a small compound with my wife and two dogs (one's pretty large at 42kg and the other is a 3 month puppy) and our neighbors also have a dog. We usually take them out on walks behind the compound where there's a big empty lot. However; you can't really walk your dogs everywhere (ie Corniche). There's a beach in an area called Al Wakra (which is about a 10-15min drive from Doha) where my wife and I usually take our two dogs out for a run and swim on Friday mornings with another friend who also has a dog. You'll see quite a few dog owners out there on the beach with their pets and as long as your dog is well behaved it's all good. It's a pretty big public beach and not crowded at all so you're bound to find a huge ""vacant lot"" where you can do your own thing and not bother anyone."	Good

Meanwhile; you won't be issued a Qatar ID until you get your medical results and sign your permanent contract. Without a Qatar ID you won't be able to rent an apartment.

When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	Good

Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.	Good

Q348_R76	Q348_R76_C5	Any aquapark in Doha?	Any Aquapark in Doha?	Dear Maji08; They did not ask you because being a resident of Qatar; you must have already done your finger print for your RP; which is saved in their comuter records. When you apply for CID clearance for a job offer; they will check on the computer your finger prints; which they will use it to process your certificate. This was done in my case both in medical and CID clearance obtained for a job offer. Hope it is clear now.	Good

Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C1	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	Those people dont earn much salary and ofcourse they are expecting you to give something for they side money( for lunch; transportation; etc) Give at least 10% of the price of what you eat..or give reasonable amount..and even better if you give it from your heart without bitching. hehehe	Good
Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C2	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	Tipping does not appear to be customary among the local population. The people who perfom the tasks you have listed typically make between 600 and 1000 riyals per month; when that's the going rate for labor; one might surmise that Qatar is not home to a culture of conspicuous generosity. I suggest that you go with your conscience; bearing in mind that anything you give will probably be put to good use. With the exception of the car washers; none of these people have any control whatsoever over the prices of the services that they perform. What they can control is the service itself; and I generally use that as the basis for my own calculations.	Good
Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C3	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	For the car wash; since it's usually 8 QR; I tip 2 QR For restaurants; I check to see if the tip has already been included in the bill. If it hasn't and the service has been good; I tip about 15 - 20 % of the total. BTW; hotels and some restaurants usually add a surcharge that is NOT the tip so check your bill - you might think tip is included when it's really not. For the gas attendants; I normally give about 3 QR when I fill up the car (it costs me about 30 QR to fill up). For the tea boy; I'm assuming the company compensates the person adequately - I haven't been here long enough but I would leave a tip at Christmas and special holidays; something like 100 QR - this also goes for the security guys at my compound. If someone pushed my cart and loaded the groceries into the car; I'd tip about 5 QR (if someone has to push my cart; it means I must have a ton of groceries). I haven't tipped the person who bags the groceries since I'm unsure about this one. I don't know the salaries of th.....	Good
Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C4	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	These guys don't get paid all that well really. I keep talking to office boys; cleaners and my houseboy quite often. Some of these are paid as low as Qrs. 450 per month. Infact; I know of our ex-office/tea boys; their company failed to renew the contract and they were jobless for couple of months. It isn't their responsibility to renew the contract obviously; but the sponsor penalised them by paying just Qrs. 100 per month until they could find another contract elsewhere! I think we are all lucky and should be thankful that we're paid really well when compared to these guys. I know few would argue that we are educated and we deserve to be where we are. But little generosity won't affect us much. 1. The guy that pushes the shopping trolley for you A: I PUSH MY OWN TROLLEY; IF SOMEONE DOES HELP ME I PAY QR. 2/- PER TROLLEY. 2. The person that washes your car A: MY HOUSEBOY WASHES MY WIFE'S CAR. WE PAY HIM A FIXED AMOUNT; BUT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS; WE PAY HIM QRS. 50 OR 100. 3. The tea boy.....	Good
Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C5	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	Don't forget; for many of the service people in restaurants; it is the restaurant that gets the tip not the server.	PotentiallyUseful
Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C6	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	its like spreading the love!! I tip everyone i can; and we all should. I tip the guys who pack my bags about ten qr once a week; tip the guys who put petrol in my car like 5 - 10 qr; never had anyone push a trolley for me thou - thats what my arms are for! tip in resturants too;thou not fast food outlets for some reason ( does anyone tip there ?) we should all tip those who can afford to; people earn very little out here and no matter who you think you are that could be you one day; so treat everyone as if you know them when you are dealing with them in these situations!

Q351_R1	Q351_R1_C7	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	I usually judge of the quality of service recieved. Unlike many place except in Doha people don't tip as often as they should. Now probably back home when you got out and do the shopping someone bags your shopping with a smile (and not a grumble) walks you to your car with a smile (and not a grumble)then you tip them well. Personally... if they just to do it for the sake of getting a tip off an expat and you hand them over 2 riyals you'll still see tham standing there waiting for more?!	Good

It's confusing sometimes; when your bill for a small tiny service is only 20 or 25 and then you have to leave a tip....ofcourse not less than 10 Riyals. I usually do not exceed 15 Riyals for services worth 100. But since most of the times you'll need more than one emplyee for more than one service;then 10 is fine for each one.	Good

A mani-pedicure costs me 100-150 (with spa/massage) and I tip the girl 10-20 riyals. Why? Coz to clean my feet and nails would take at least an hour; plus cleaning the ingrown without causing you to bleed; wounded...is a feat. (no pun intended). These women who works in the salon works from 8:30AM to 11:00PM; no overtime pay; salary is about 1000-1500 a month and some of them only have HALF DAY offs.

My criteria in tipping the taxi driver are: 1- Don't ask me no questions about me or don't tell me where you from. I got my Confession Booth for those moments. 2- Don't drive like you are driving Miss Daisy or some Indianapolis 500 racing stock car in the roads. Better use those turn signals and do your yielding. I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits. 3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance; it just gives me a headache. I Don't want memories of the local malls. 4- Better have the meter on and pronounce those numbers properly. 5- and learn to difference between; drive Straight ahead; turn left and turn right.

Q351_R11	Q351_R11_C9	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	I think it's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters. I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service. Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it; for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.	Good

Please note that for every 10 person you will serve on the bar there are only 2 possible person that can give you a tip personally. Here in Qatar tips are not usually considered unless by the white peoples. But you need also to consider the company policy on tipping; for there are some which is centralized.

Q351_R20	Q351_R20_C4	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one. I may have missed it; though; as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. If you are going to a hotel first; you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it. I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty. Just ask when you check in. If you are going to your accommodation; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so). Ask your driver for advice. City Center Doha (the big mall); which I live across from; is like this. 10 minutes and the money problem is solved. Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM. However; Doha is pretty wired. You ca.....	Good
Q351_R20	Q351_R20_C5	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	Thanks for your comments and advice. The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel. I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not. I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card. Thanks again for your help.	Bad
Q351_R20	Q351_R20_C6	"Tipping?	""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent."	Mmm... well; I can see your point there. However; as you're just arriving in the country; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute. Or I'd hope not. Besides; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country; UK included). So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down. If you're going to the hotel; and you really want to tip the driver; just ask him to wait for a second. Run in; tell them what you want to do; and change a bill. Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop; tell them you're changing money in just a second; and then give it back after you've changed money. Truthfully; though; I wouldn't sweat it too much. You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. Which hotel? The Intercon is quite nice. The breakfast buffet is gigantic. Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least). Fresh fruit juices. A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.	Good

And in return god will give more than what you gave to somebody. We in fact; if not of them cleaning the road or our environment here in qatar; maybe qatar is a big mess.

Here is the thing; the shopkeepers are brainless idiots! Why? Take my local shop for example. There are no price tags on anything. You have to ask them 'how much is this'.

That way I won't get annoyed at thinking I am losing money. They could do this without causing half the arguments. Do I want to pay more for my shopping?

It's confusing sometimes; when your bill for a small tiny service is only 20 or 25 and then you have to leave a tip....ofcourse not less than 10 Riyals.

When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home	PotentiallyUseful

"One of the best customer services I have experienced in Doha is at the Commercial Bank. They never neglect your emails when you complain; they try to understand every detail of your problem and give you options to solve it; and they keep following up until you are satisfied. I have a similar pleasant experience with the manager of the service center of United Cars. He makes sure to read your emails and sends instant instructions to his employees to fix the problems. Unfortunately there are companies who don't bother if their customers are happy or not. They come from a background of: ""take it or leave it...you don't have any other option"" My brother experienced this lately with QGRABS.

Hi Tashkent. First; Iâ€™m a local. So; I might not be fair in giving you a clear opinion about us. Well; like every society there is the good; bad & the ugly. According to statistics; the highest percentage of the population is concentrated on the ages 20-30. Unfortunately; youâ€™ll find allot of shallow youth wondering on shopping malls; with no interest in education; employment; religion or life matters. Their only concern is having a posh car with unique number! As if it really matters. Yet; there are some educated youth; socializing and volunteering in good deeds.

Locals in Qatar are the least friendly and approachable of all people. They do tend to keep to themselves and they rarely allow outsiders to become their friends. This is sad as foreigners tend to stereotype a lot because of that; but how could we possibly know any better? In my 4 years in Qatar I met very few Qatari girls socially and I haven't made any real friendships with them. I believe it's very difficult; if not impossible.	Good

E46M3; I am glad to hear that. However; I believe it's different with guys :^) As the society is so strictly segregated; men in Qatar are totally different from the ladies.

"that's my experience; too. I guess it's more of the culture; where it's more difficult for the ladies to widen their social circles.

Twice i've had an abaya wearing lady step right in front of me in a queue. The thing is; what made it worse was; both those times the queues were not long. In fact there were 3 people max. I mean; how long am i going to take paying for 1 t-shirt? Another time; i was in the ladies room at the movies and waiting patiently in front of of the stalls and again; another abaya lady steps right in as soon as the door opened and the person inside came out!

From my previous post -------------- All the US iPhones that came on week 45 and after have the 1.1.2 firmeware; with the new bootloader version 4.6. Those phones can still be jailbroken and activated; but there is no software sim unlock solution yet. To find out the week on your iPhone check the 4th and 5th digit of serial number. This number can be found on the bottom of box in which you received the iPhone. if it is 45 and above then there is no software solution to unlock the phone right now; Hardware solution TurboSim is your only option I guess. If you Serial number indicates that it is less that 45 then your iPhone can be unlocked. If not your choices are 1. Use TurboSim or similar HW method to unlock. 2. Jailbreak the iPhone and use it like iPod touch till a software unlock method is published. hope this helps --------------	PotentiallyUseful

You could ask for a phone whose manufacturing week is less than 45. ( which can be verified by the serial Number.) I wonder if apple stores will stock phones with less than 45 weeks manufacturing. You could try other sources besides apple as well. In the worst case apple iPhones are also available in Qatar except that they are slightly (or very) costly. As far as unlocking the phone is concerned have no worry. Dandy here seems to be an expert at it. Still if you have any problems unlocking let me know; I will do it for you and if required teach you how to do it. (without any deal.)	PotentiallyUseful

Qatar Academy maybe the school where money is no object but the academic standards are not as impressive; especially in Primary.

Noticed you are from the Netherlands; there is a Shell School in Doha that has the Dutch curriculum incorporated into it.

We relocated our teenagers in August and finally settled for QIS and are very pleased because the school has been extremely helpful and supportive in accepting two non-native speaking kids into year 10 and 12. We can recommend the school to 100%. Our kids came from the liberal Swedish school system but have settled very well. We have visited ALL English-speaking schools in Doha; and the only problem is that they are all full. Waitlisting and constant telephone calls to find out if something is happening is my advice.

Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks.

Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much.

Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad.

Guys; It depends on the nature of the ban. Normally a ban is a no entry situation. If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries.

Hi Tinkerbell10; Your comment seems to originate from utter frustration. As you might have observed; in many aspects Qatar takes Dubai as a role model where such exit permit; 2 year ban etc does not exist and therefore the world love that place. Qatar; while trying to attract international attraction eventually has to remove such bondage rules. For example; the employees can keep their pass ports but they cannot exit the country without the consent of their employer sounds like an irony. If people come to work in Qatar on a 2 year contract; they should be given choice to renew or switch to another job after successfully completing the contract. I hope the perception of Qatar Govt will change eventually to catch the international attention..as a moderately free place.	Good

But someone has to voice such plights to the public in some reasonable way.

Qatar will change and for the better; remember how far Qatar has come in just 15 years. Yes it has the money to do it but it has taken other countries 500 years to change this much but they didn't have to swamp the countries with foreigners to do it. Imagine living in your own country and being outnumbered 8 to 1 by foreigners. That is not an easy change.

Before we compare Al Ahli with Hamad Gen Hospital; you should take into consideration to the number of patients going to Hamad and Al Ahli. HGH is the tertiary centre for whole of Qatar.This is in addition to the internal referances for the vast number of patients coming into HGH emergencies.Govt has done a lot to reduce the burden on HGH by opening Wakrah;Al Khor;Cuban hospitals and now Sidra in line. Hope things will be better in future.This is true for nationals as well not for expat alone.	Good

Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future.

I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem.

Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....	Good

I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.	Good

I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you.

Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....	Good

I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right?

Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....	Good

If your husband wants to apply for sponsoring you and your kids then thats a whole other big process i think. If you have a PRO guy check with him which is the easy way out.	Good

Huhhhhh.?.. You may need the legal process of adoption for your kids even your are their biological mother. Now that is plain silly....Adopt your own kids...what you talking about? But; smoke is right; you can sponsor your kids and hubby even if your spouse is not your kids biological kids; they are now his step children. Apply if you think you meet the new requirements for women to be the sponsor. On a separate note; your new spouse can adopt your kids; but that is not a requirement for YOU to sponsor your own kids. :)	Good

Since you are sponsored by your husband; your husband can also sponsor your kids...just present your authenticated marriage certificate and ... i think there will an interview as new procedure for family visa by the Dept of Labor...i assumed your kids are minor? so there's a big chance that your husband can sponsor your kids since they are considered as his kids also by affinity . . .

I was not allowed to sponsor my husband on family visa either. Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.

"LP ?? ""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."	PotentiallyUseful

If your husband's salary is still below QR10;000 he cannot sponsor you and your kids. You said your kids are under your sponsorship; so why do you want to transfer?

You won't get an approval if your husband's salary is below 10;000...the reason behind it is you cannot live comfortably if your whole family is with you; and the head of the family earning only 5;000.

I would suggest to ask someone from qatar to play as sponsor in behalf of ur fiancee; much better if its a woman bcoz Qatar culture doesn't tolerate such things that a guy will sponsor a girl without any immediate relation. in addition to; the Phil. immigration might ask u for additional docs like sponsor letter; bank statement; show money; married cert if your married etc. just to satisfy them that ur genuine visitor in the country. I will advice u to go to an agency so they could help u find an sponsor.	PotentiallyUseful

"it depends on your visa. If you entered Qatar with the Vsit Visa; ou don't need an exit permit. If you came on Business Visa and stay LESS than 1 month; you still do not need a visa. If you came on Business Visa and stay more than 1 month; you will need an Exit permit.

Sponsorship law gets nod Web posted at: 2/27/2009 3:38:52 Source ::: THE PENINSULA By MOBIN PANDIT and MOHAMMED SALEM DOHA: Qatar yesterday issued a new sponsorship law that retains salient features of the previous legislation; which was enforced some 45 years ago. ........... The new law (No. 4 of 2009) regulating the entry; exit; residence and sponsorship of foreigners was ratified by the Heir Apparent H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and will be enforced with immediate effect. Qatari women married to foreigners will be allowed to sponsor their husbands and children. ...........	Good

Non-muslim men cannot marry a Muslim lady i believe you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty; this is not a normal event in Qatar. Other questions can arise about children; that's why u get married; in the past they could not automatically be Qatari! either way Qatar is changing; the fact that you can meet a Qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult! proceed carefully!

"Well; for one thing; you don't just move to Qatar. You have to have a residence visa; which means you have to be sponsored; usually by a family member or an employer. They're not going to let your BF sponsor you. Can you live together? If you don't mind living illegally; sure; you can live together. Whether this in fact turns into a problem will depend on a whole lot of factors; but you should be aware that it CAN turn into the sort of problem that spells p-r-i-s-o-n and d-e-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n. You can drink; lots of people do (I do); but you will be in a Muslim country under Sharia law. You would be well advised to be very discreet. Lastly; Qatar would not be my first choice if having ""a good time"" were all that important to me. I think of it more as a place that one navigates as best one can.

Qatar is amongst the more liberal of Gulf countries I believe; which isn't saying enough because the Gulf does not even compare to the liberality of the fertile crescent Arab countries like Syria; Lebanon and Jordan. Though I personally don't drink; the vast majority of people I know do; and they do not seem to have a problem accessing it (which makes for some interesting weekends I can assure you!) Where in the US do you live? And what are your qualifications? Have you considered looking for a job here? If you are thinking about getting married to the guy; I believe he can sponsor you; contact the American Embassy for more info (though i never found them to be particularly resourceful lol).

"Yes; you can live together - You'll need to be discreet; i.e. do not tell your muslim friends and acquaintances about it. Yes; you can go out for drinks - No need to be discreet here as long as you consume in bars and night clubs (which are almost always in hotels) and your home. During Ramadan you can only drink up at home and it's common practice to stock up on booze before this period. Also; never ever get into trouble with the cops when drunk. Drink driving is definitely not advisable. But; I agree fully with ""OOO"". Come in on a holiday and see for yourself before you decide."	Good

Here is not Heaven. They have laws that the West does not follow. Here being close to or committing adultry; fornication or sodomy is not allowed. Also; drinking is not allowed.

I dont think there is any problem with the issues you have raised. I have a few western friends who have been living together for quite a while now.

If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin; you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist; for a small fee). If you have entered the country on a business visa; your sponsor wi.....	Good

Which one do you want do you prepare? Some people has no driving license driving around Doha and when they meet accident they run and leave their vehicles because they can be in a serious trouble in this country! or Some people are driving legally using their International Driving License but in process of the local Driving license as you cannot avoid it; you should apply for the local one too! In my case; before having the local driving license; I was depending on my Int'l Driving license; since I arrived here for at least 7 to 8 months; I had an accident and had my Resident Permit and showed it to the traffic police and voala! my car is fixed back to it's beauty!

Here are a few (not tried and tested) but you can always get adventorous : 1. Ask personal questions to the most snobish salesman at a snobish outlet. 2. Talk in a higly accented english with the same snobish salesman (rehearse beforehand- another way to kill time). 3. Give a fake smile to people at corniche. Make it snappy like a flash. 4. Make funny/scary faces at kids on corniche. 5. Make a list of all swear words you know and keep the list ready for use (in purse/besides phone/in your car). 6. If you are working than prepare a list of important phone numbers in the smallest font possible and stick it on your computer monitor with a bright sticker. Think and analyse the reaction of your work mates on weekends. Bye and cheers.	Good

It's not what you do; or what there is to do; it's who you do it with! A weekend alone is not good; you need to meet someone or some friends to spend time with; then the weekend will be too short. Although there is much to do in Doha; it is boring doing it alone. Take up a new sport or hobby that involves meeting people. I started playing golf and met loads of people.

To all those who were looking for possible Arabic tutoring by a native speaker . . . I am a native speaker from Palestine. I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States; whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans; Mexicans; Brasilians; Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether.

"Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School. If they get accepted then leave the UK. This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council. All the rest of the British school claim they ""follow"" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school; they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals. Sadly; the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints."	Good

DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary. For me ; no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College; Parkhouse; Sherbourne & Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference; I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available; do prepare to fly them immediately.	Good

There are some great new schools opening; for instance the International School of London or the American College School (though obviously not British curriculum). I've switched my daughter from Park House (a British school I STRONGLY recommend you avoid); to the aforementioned ACS-- they had immediate availability; being so new. Also; many schools have relationships with certain companies; so check if that is true for your husband's company. Good luck!	Good

My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)	Good

"I disagree with Expatemily (I am a friend in real life with her) Park House is a great school. Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage; Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also ""reasonably"" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places. Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list."	Good

"Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed. To date I believe there might be about 6 ""best"" schools in doha; based on what; usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment. It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school ""it must be the school"". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay; as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism. Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools. I have a child of 13 who will either go to DBS or DC but personally I would have him in ASD (no chance) but not because the rest are rubbish just because I personally got a better f....."

" ""You never cared to even mention or refer to the home made rockets being fired.""   rockets being fired WHERE? On Zionist settlers who were provided with Palestinean homes by their armies after having ripped off these homes from the original Palestineans? I think these invaders/settlers should go back to the countries they came from. ""There are women and children on both sides"" Yes! On 1 side there are the women & children of the original owners of the land who were living peacefully like every nation on earth; and on the other side there are the women & children who left their countries around the world; came to invade a country which don't belong to them; started killing the families of the original owners; and stole their homes.

I do not support in any way the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis and the tragic loss of life of innocents is unforgiveable. What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths. Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.  	Good

If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way; apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification; now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit.

It just happened that i have friends from QA and EY. why would they hide so many details from you? On the contract; you will find everything you need to know about your salary and benefits so I'm wondering why you are so confused. I don't recommend you to take the housing allowance hence accept the accommodation that QA will provide for you. If you are a bachelor; you don't need to spend 10K for a flat. I don't get most of your point. Sorry. cheers; paul	Bad

Not necesserarily is your bank; is the institution where the alliance for the visa is coming from. It just pop in my mind; Maybe your bank just have the card block; and they need to lift it. That is just another option. One time in Kenya ; my bank block it; because they tought soemone stole it.

Thank you."""	Hey ! Welcome to Qatar. Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives. Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also; you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access.....	Good

But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	Good

What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done.

When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250.

She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home	PotentiallyUseful

The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually.

In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps. If anyone needs help on there resume/CV; I can always spare some time to look it over. JhunBug	Good

Just present the offer letter & a letter from the company ( new) that your visa is under process. On receipt of letter; please approach your branch. If you don't find a suitable job & want travel ban so that you can find a suitable job; please make sure that you give guarantee cheques against your loan to bank so they will do the rest.

Hi; If your spouse is under your sponsorship: meaning the visa indicated on his/her Qatar ID or Resident Permit is Family Visa; then there is no need for them to be sponsored by an employer unless you feel that there will be more benefits that you can get if your spouse will get to be sponsored by the company they got accepted at. But if your spouse's visa is just Family Visit; and they landed a job with another company and you cannot have him/her under family visa; you just have to submit a No Objection Letter to transfer the sponsorship.

Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months); he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship. As for the Residence permit; you won't be able to obtain RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you. All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.	Good

Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much.

Salleh...salary is relative to what you do for a living. Having said that you can be the best judge of how good or bad your offer is once you've done some research. DO a search in QL. Plenty of threads bout cost of living in Doha. 1. 2 br apartment 8500-12000 pm 2. Groceries for two 2500 pm 3. Water + electricity 500 pm 4. Telephone+internet+cable 500-100 pm 5.

If they can't house you then you dont take it. Or at least get it in the contract that they will pay your Housing Rent Bill as the rents increase 25% every year. If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker. Bilabong is on the spot with the rates. No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) & sell it for QR 25;000-30;000 when you leave Qatar.

Is that I can't see a problem with going off topic if the thread is a light one; such as Paul arranging a social get-together or someone putting up a joke for everyone to have a go at or add to etc. I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread; which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have (if it doesn't fit in the more serious forums); then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose. Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK; before coming over to Doha; I typed into google a question about; say; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL. It was informative; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted!

I have read so many of the threads and come back all the time to read more - informative and very entertaining. I hope to get there soon so I can join the Social Group.

"Um_Nooh and aquabong; With all respect to cleaners and tea boys. I do respect them a lot and if I had to use ranks; I would consider them all; way above most of the people who exercise a ""management"" position here in Qatar. Each one of them have a sad story behind them and most of them are heroes suffering under an unjust society. For your information; from where I come from; a cleaner and a person who serves tea/coffee; is regarded as important as a senior manager and their salaries sometimes are not too apart. The social benefits are equal. We grow up with a diversity of people and racism is just not part of our upbringing! My reply to Um_Nooh; came out that way because of the way she posted her question! Anybody could figure out that salaries vary in accordance with the activity you are going to exercise. Um_Nooh assumed that either we could guess her qualifications and targeted job; or whatever. My answer was deliberated for her to think about her error and at the same time to high....."	Bad

Nic - when i talked about lack of class and respect; it had nothing to do; and was not directed towards individuals that work as tea/coffee servers; and hence lead to me feeling offended.... it was directed to how you answered me! You were the person that I felt lacked class and respect (and that is without knowing your professional background). If you want to talk about answering; and stating things appropriately; you could have chosen your words in a more decent manner. Follow what you preach basically. The fact that not only I was offened but another member as well; who if I may add is NOT qatari; shows a lot about your approach. Please do not assume that just because I am Qatari; I do not value people that work as tea/coffee servers; or anyone else for that matter! Just as you assumed the worst in me; and thought I sterotyped them as being low class citizens; you were a hypocrite to assume that as a Qatari that is how I would think of them!

(Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....

The wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings; pushing the plane upwards. Air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below. So the aircraft must be moving towards the air; to get this effect. for the smarter ones out there; you should know that; the speed at which the air hits the wings (basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind) is proportional to the amount of lift given. helicopters are the same; only that the rotor blades; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path.

"Not only can an Airbus (or any other commercial aircraft) not ""stand still"" in the air; it must be going at least 155 knots (or approx 175 miles per hour) in order to stay in the air; relative to the wind speed.

Technically; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600Kmph. This wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground. This wud means it has zero ground speed. An aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed. Airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body.

I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	Good

Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.	Good

I thought it was a bit boring.     Beautiful decorations (heard they cost 60;000QR) ; tables; lots of sweets.   However it got started very very late  (left at11:00pm; dinner had not started)   Out of 300 women in the room I only saw I dress that I liked.   Most were garish and hideously gaudy.   Lots of Bright bright colors; feathers; sequins; etc.    TONS of makeup on.    They had a runway and a couple of women played the drums and wailed Arabic songs rather loudly.   Girls would get up and dance down the runway (so the older women could check them out as possible daugher-in-law contenders I've been told) Finally the lights went down about 10:00 the fog and light show started--sort of like a rock concert!   The bride then came out and walked very slowly down the runway.    Eventually people came up and showered her head with money.  She looked scared to death.  I learned she was 20 years old and had never met her husband-to-be; but had talked to him on the.....

PS: oh yeah; like many others mentioned above; dont click any snaps. n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside. usually they hold it at the entrance. so be prepared to be disconnected from the rest of the world for the few hours u spent there..

Unfortunately; I have found Qatari weddings to be a bit depressing... I have yet to see it as a joyous occassion... I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason.... The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing...

You can get in big trouble as pork is banned in Qatar. The same for alcohol! After you collect your luggage at the airport; you have to pass it through a scan.

I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight. Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).	Good

Hi Cath; I'm also planning to take my car from Dubai to Doha. However; I have a couple of issues: 1. I just moved to Qatar a couple of weeks ago and haven't received my Resident Permit yet because they told me I have to cancel my Dubai visa first (even though it's my own investor visa) 2. I'm going to Dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then I was planning to come back in my car. Will I be able to obtain the transit visa in Saudi border if I have a Canadian passport? 3. If I get an NOC from my employer in Qatar; will that be sufficient to import my car from Dubai to Doha. 4. Will I have to pay the 5% tax if my car is 3 yrs old? Is there any way to avoid it?

"As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told ""long sleeves and long skirts"". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter).

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..

I recommend that she wear ""normal"" clothes; this is totally acceptable for ""western ladies"". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection.

But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs; without the Hijab; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat. So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again; if you want to show your body to the world? lol; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari :) Correct me if Im wrong. Hope your not one among these people. Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari (I guess) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside. What the devil did she want to potray?

I will second DaRuDe; last year; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one. Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold. Granted the cold snap does not last long; but who would want to give up their sleep. Days are pretty warm.

I DO want to gauge excatly how severe/negative the response would be if I did; say; decide to travel to the beach in a pair of shorts and a tank top with bikini underneath. Some of the clothing I own (and love!)now I wouldn't DREAM of wearing out there. I'd probably be deported... :P BUT; I was at least hoping to hear that some people do still keep some of their original dress habits without too much backlash. I guess I'll just have to see how it goes when I'm out there. Maybe I should do some more research on Islamic Customs; but can anyone explain why women are required to cover shoulders/knees in the first place? I'm very curious. Thanks."	Bad

Yes it's alright for men to wear short sleeve shirts.Like you said the more conservative;the better and that rule applies to men as well.As this is a conservative muslim country;total respect for local customs and traditions need to be observed.Women aren't advised to wear sleeve less shirts or tops as well as shorts.Business dress code is the same as anywhere else.For men formal suiting and for women nothing specific bit it has be decent so as not to offend anyone and more importantaly;to avoid any sort of unwanted attention.

You will need 2-3 sessions to understand how to master ""L"" parking on the ramp; Box (pocket) parking forward (Note- You have only one chance to move; no reverse-forward combination allowed.) Karwa charges QAR 100 for every hr if you dont take course.. 3. Road tests are offbeat than you drive every day e.g. Theory class say you need to exit roundabout in same lane you enter...but they teach you to exit in fist lane no matter which lane you enter (Thats police test requirement) and similar things. 4.

Practice this until you are no more; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started. . . . . 2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops. . . . . 3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable. . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone. Start practicing this first and let me know when you are confident enough about this... “We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.” Sir Winston Churchill	Good

To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!

Senior police official Gopal Chandra Nanda would not say whether the burned homes belonged to Hindus or Christians; but said an investigation was under way. The attacks took place in Tikabali; a town in Kandhamal district that has been the center of the unrest. Police have imposed a strict curfew across the district for the past week.

Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether.

Once I read from an expert that learning Arabic needs ten times more time and effort than learning English for example . The big problem is not the letters - they are easy to learn - but the words ... There are so many dialects that you have to choose one dialect first of all . Or if you choose the standard Arabic then you will understand speakers of news channels or religious teachers - but you will not be able to communicate or they will just laugh at you .... Sometimes it seems to me that there is not such thing that Arabic language . There are dialects which are similar to each other like French is similar to Italian or to Spanish .	PotentiallyUseful

We have 2 children one in pre4 at school and the other 3 still at home. We have a nanny who takes care of the 3 year old. We went through the newspaper and interviewed about 20 and had about 40 call. Out of 20 there were about 3 we would have gone with. We decided on one and it was O.K. but after about 2 or 3 weeks we let her go. Were going to do add again but through contacts in the building and info from our pervious add campaign we found another nanny. It has been about 6 months now and all is good. We need to revisit expectations once in a while but overall we are pleased. We have play dates arranged each week for the nanny to take our child and we have other expectations that we hope insure a nuturing and healthy day. There is good and bad to both senerios.

I have been doing research on this MBA thing in Doha for the last one year or more but so far I have found nothing worthwhile. The only options available were at Qatar university but I am not sure about its credentials and the second option was National education center somewhere near Lulu. They offer MBA evening classes couple of times a week and the degree we get is from Allagappa university of Madras. The third option is Doha Training Center; they had an ad in the papers a few weeks ago. They too are offering MBA thu some American university or atleast that is what they claimed but when I went there to check it out; it turned out to be some American university based in the Phillipines. Even the degree that we would get after completing it would say Phillipines on it. So I decided that it is better to do some distance MBA from my own country Pakistan than to go for that.. If any of you find out some good and recognized MBA degree being offered in Qatar; please let me know. Thanks	Good

This day and age; 512mb is the minimum for a good experience. If you can afford it; I say buy a new laptop with at least 1gb ram and a good processor. You don't game or do any media editting so you don't need to worry about having a speedy processor or a great graphics card. Watch out though if you get vista. Although it's supposed to be better; I find that XP is much better. OR if you wanted a great all in one solution. Get a Macbook.

The HR employee of alfardan group (which is also a filipino) said to me that i can sponsor my wife after i get a residence permit there. probably the processing for RP according to her is about 2 months.

I also have several officemates before here in the phil who are now working there. I hope i can find a way to cut-off my expenses and i will really tighting up my budget to save.

As far as the reputation of Al Fardan goes; it has a very good reputation in Qatar. They are rich as a company I guess; cause they seem to have their own Money exchange; High quality Jewelery shops; dealerships for Range Rover; BMW and Ferrari ... SO that does have some weight...

Q376_R41	Q376_R41_C5	if i finance my self?	if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	Good

In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."	Good

"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers...

Q376_R46	Q376_R46_C2	if i finance my self?	if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?	I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.	Good
Q376_R46	Q376_R46_C3	if i finance my self?	if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?	Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....	Good

What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete. I think it will be ok for some time to come.

Q376_R46	Q376_R46_C5	if i finance my self?	if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?	Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.	Good

I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl?

"You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say ""I hope"" and ""I think"" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term ""no-brainer"". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us.

Here's a tip; you should first read the job requirement and qualifications; then you should cater your resume/CV to what they're looking for. Most big companies don't really have real people going through those resumes/CV; they have a software that look for keywords. In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps.

"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."	Good

I got a call from unistaff that my visa is already with them. I went for my medical last Sept. 20; 2012. They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....

A PMP certificate is not worth the paper it is printed on. Employers want experience; a construction/project management degree and evidence that you started a project and completed a project. I have reviewed many cv's and the majority of people with PMPs have simply not delivered projects; they have been involved; spent a long time ghetting all sorts of qualifications but when you ask them about the basics of project management their lack of practical; varied experience; shines through.

I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course; I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted. Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts. I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication. I wud say go for it. Good luck.	Good

A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are: What scale would you want to work with? What era or region of train type? How much space do you have for a layout? The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge; they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale; you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.	Good

Don't hate me diamondgirl....this certainly does not apply to everyone....but my personal experience here in doha is that MOST do not speak english. Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist.

Good Morning; Unfortunately; this is a melting pot for different languages Tagalog; Hindi; Urdu; Arabic and English please forgive any languages I forgot. Now not wishing to offend anyone but Arabic and English are the main business languages; however; Indians have derived their onw english after the British left and even I have difficulty understanding many of them. Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.	PotentiallyUseful

Don't worry; Qatari's do a good job of wearing fashionable clothes as well as traditional clothes :) I don't really like GAP; but I do like their stretch shirts (which I like to wear under a t-shirt).

Q380_R27	Q380_R27_C6	Villagio...	Hi friends... Do you have any update regarding Villagio's opening?	And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!	Good

Both of which; we had no question about or might probably; from where I got my loan; they have different way of reflecting the added amount in my monthly statements or I was not given enough time to discover about that as I had to settle the loaned amount after just 2 months of availing it as we decided already to move here afterwards.

Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....	Good

Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....

So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.	Good

"You are lucky Razingbull......if these are quality measures why they are hiding at the time of admission if someone insist to pay exam fee at the same time they said you will pay three days before exams.....why they are showing such double standards;if they are quality conscious then must inform to students ""if you pass pre-test then institute allows you to go for test if you agree then take admission"" other wise they are over ruling the permission given by government/traffic department which allows for direct test or short course."

QF has a standardized classification level that ties in with pay. The pay level depends upon the needs of the job; not on your qualifications. $25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level; i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position. $16;000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha; so I would think that is probably a good salary; but again it depends on the job. The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter. QF is pretty fair about pay; and is an employer of choice in Qatar.	Good

Is it better than you are making now? Is it a job you like and want to do? QF will pay for the job; not for your years of experience in another position. So; I'd say if you like the job; go for it.

The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department; not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there; and inquire about the brand specifically.

Another one of these questions written most probably by a Qatarbeautyshop employee/owner with the answer being reference to Qatarbeautyshop in the first 3 posts... It is not difficult to find small and extra small sizes in Qatar. As for Qatarbeautyshop; i'd personally would not buy clothes online unless i've tried them out - and i'm a guy. Women are more picky. Moreover shopping in malls/window shopping is one big pastime in Qatar - sorry but your business may not be that feasible in Qatar. Nevertheless wish you all the best however please stop these posts - it is very cheap and does not look good for your business.	Bad

Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards	Good

""Is it true that there is Mall of Asia opening in Doha; Qatar?..If yes?..Then; is it in justice if I'll will just receive 1000riyal monthly?excluding the commission."	growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!! Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night. Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. Dweller; you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St. My Dad used to shop there a lot. I remember when.....	Good
