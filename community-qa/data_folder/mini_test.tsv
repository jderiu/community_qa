Kat yep very true about the type of work you are experienced in; if the position can be filled local the mindset is.....why hire a American that will want more salary then a different nationality? Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day.

Q318_R19	Q318_R19_C4	how to find a job?	hi i am new at this forum; so sorry if u were already speaking about this topic. i am planning to move to doha on the end of this year; together with husband. he is chef in the restaurant and we are wondering how to find jobs for both of us . I am speaking english ; arabic; greek and serbian; so maybe if it is possible something in the tourism. which web sites i should visit? thanx	I am not sure on what condition you are going to move to Doha; but it looks like both of you guys don't have a job in Qatar... So actually you have to star from searching job. As has been mentioned; try to browse Internet for the advertismenets. Then you can get phone/fax numbers and e-mails of particular hotels; and send your CVs directly to these hotels. When you find the job; the Comapany will issue visa for you; and only after that you can come to Qatar. Good luck. *********************** This Too Shall Pass..... [img_assist|nid=71431|title=magic ring|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]	Good
