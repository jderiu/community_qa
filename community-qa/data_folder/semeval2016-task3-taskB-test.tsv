As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone. Hope to meet some of you after we arrive!	1.0	0.194308	1.0	0.000594809	0.9999	3.29751e-10	2.21285e-06	0.000334963	0.0213876	8.67463e-06	1.0	0.000781123	1.0	1.14714e-06	0.847237	1.84358e-11	4.62459e-06	1.21737e-06	4.09575e-05	4.63569e-09	Irrelevant
